      <h3>Proximity as a Factor for Food Insecurity</h3>
      <p>
        Food insecurity is a topic that I've grown passionate about in recent years and 
        when researching the general topic I found research on how people measure food 
        insecurity. The interesting thing that I found was that proximity to adequate food
        (i.e. how many grocery stores are within X miles of your home) wasn't that prevalent
        in the literature. Thus, I wrote a research proposal for a final project to incorporate
        proximity as an indicator variable, using Tacoma, WA as the study area.

        Disregard the Budget section, the class wasn't focused on creating an accurate budget because of time constraints and more financial variables to consider and the professor wanted us to put more time into the research than the budgeting.

      <h3>Seasonality of Crime in Seattle</h3>
      <p>
        Crime was a topic that we had collectively landed on, however the seasonality idea
        came after we found the data. The sheer volume and thoroughness of Seattle Police 
        Department's crime data allowed us to hone in on specific categories of crime and
        organize each data point into temporal categories for seasons in order for us to 
        our analyses.

      <h3>Minimum Wage Rent Affordability Index</h3>
      <p>
        Using data for the two most populous cities in each US state, I created a composite 
        index that would score each city on its rent affordability. The indicators I used 
        were minimum wage, rent for a 1-bedroom apartment, rent for a 2-bedroom apartment, 
        and the percentage of a month's income for full-time minimum wage work for one 
        person that would be a month's rent for a 1-bedroom apartment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Data was sourced form Zumper's rent-research API.
