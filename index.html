                <p>A little bit about myself, I'm a recent graduate
                    from the University of Washington in Seattle. I 
                    got a bachelor's degree in Geography: Data Science 
                    with a minor in Informatics.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm fascinated with the interdisciplinary-ness of
                    data science, there's so much to learn from  the 
                    intersections between domains of expertise. I'm 
                    so excited to take my academics into the real world 
                    and really figure out how much more there is to know!

                    <p>The job hunt is on! LinkedIn and Handshake have become my best friends, but 
                        I'm still worried about my portfolio. I don't have anything that's 
                        machine learning related so I've been working my way through the entire 
                        Kaggle courseline so I can refresh on the various ML algorithms and models.
                        <br><br>
                        From there, the goal is to do some basic projects to showcase my knowledge 
                        of those facets then conduct my own unique project to expand my portfolio. 
                        One idea is to see if a model could predict/project homelessness for an area. 
                        Data from the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
                        would be strong candidates for sources, however I think city/specific area 
                        data would be the hardest to pinpoint.

                    <h1>Proximity as an Indicator for Measuring Food Insecurity</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p> For one of my classes I wrote a research paper centered around
                        measuring food insecurity. From the literature that I found, 
                        proximity (i.e. to the nearest grocery store(s)) was not brought 
                        up as an indicator variable. There was a lot of weight on variables 
                        that dealt with finances, which I thought proximity has a hand in. 
                        Proximity indicates if you are within walking distance or if you 
                        need money for public transit or gas. It indicates your food options, 
                        some places have more variety or overall better quality products. 
                        Thus, I proposed a study that could be conducted in Tacoma, WA since 
                        that's where I'm from and it made it easier to plan things out.
                        <br><br>
                        Disregard the Budget section, the class wasn't 
                        focused on creating an accurate budget because of time 
                        constraints and more financial variables to consider and the 
                        professor wanted us to put more time into the research than 
                        the budgeting.</p>

                    <h1>Seasonality of Crime in Seattle</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>My group members and I found ourselves being really interested in crime
                        data, and when we found data on the city's open data portal with almost 
                        a million rows we knew we were onto something. The data was extremely 
                        thorough which allowed us to be very flexible/unique-ish when it came 
                        to topics. We landed on a temporal analysis of specific types of crime 
                        and chose seasonality because it sounded interesting. Luckily, that decision 
                        meant a lot less graphs to make which meant we wouldn't oversaturate the reader 
                        with visualizations.

                    <br>
                    <p>Using data for the two most populous cities in each US state, I 
                        created a composite index that would score each city on its rent 
                        affordability. The indicators I used were minimum wage, rent for 
                        a 1-bedroom apartment, rent for a 2-bedroom apartment, and the 
                        percentage of a month's income for full-time minimum wage work 
                        for one person that would be a month's rent for a 1-bedroom 
                        apartment. Data was sourced form Zumper's rent-research API.</p>
